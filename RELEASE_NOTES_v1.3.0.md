## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Visibility Controls Fixed
**Issue:** Display visibility settings weren't working - items remained visible even when unchecked.

**Root Cause:** CSS selectors were looking for both `.hide-*-view` and `.view-mode` classes on the same element, but they were on different elements (scoreboard div vs body).

**Fix:** Changed selectors from `.hide-*-view.view-mode` to `.view-mode .scoreboard.hide-*-view`

**Result:** ✅ Display settings now work correctly - can hide items on display while keeping them on control interface.

### 2. Timer Overflow Fixed
**Issue:** Timer text was overflowing outside its border box, especially with large font sizes.

**Fix:**
- Added `overflow: hidden` to timer-outline
- Added `line-height: 1` to prevent vertical overflow
- Reduced letter-spacing for better fit
- Adjusted font sizes for proper containment
- Increased padding for breathing room

**Result:** ✅ Timer stays perfectly contained at all sizes.

### 3. Duplicate Games in History Fixed
**Issue:** Games appeared twice in history list with different cases (game-ABC and game-abc).

**Root Cause:** generateGameId() created uppercase IDs but sanitizeGameId() converted to lowercase. Before/after sanitization, both versions were added to history.

**Fix:**
- Sanitize game ID before adding to history
- Normalize all IDs to lowercase in addToHistory()
- Added deduplicateHistory() function
- Case-insensitive comparison
- Auto-cleanup on page load

**Result:** ✅ No more duplicate games, all IDs consistently lowercase.
