   - Choose a location close to your users

3. **Configure Firestore Rules**:
   - In Firestore, go to the "Rules" tab

   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /scoreboards/{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if true;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Click "Publish"

4. **Get Firebase Config**:
   - Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
   - Scroll to "Your apps" section
   - Click the web icon (`</>`) to add a web app
   - Register your app with a nickname (e.g., "Meerkats Board")
